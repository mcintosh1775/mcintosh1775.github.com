## What is a Bitcoin Node?

**Network Component:** Bitcoin nodes are the essential infrastructure that secures and maintains the Bitcoin network. They ensure the network's integrity by validating transactions and blocks according to Bitcoin's consensus rules.

Bitcoin nodes are computers that run Bitcoin software and maintain a complete copy of the blockchain. They participate in the Bitcoin network by:

- **Validating transactions** - Checking that transactions follow Bitcoin's rules
- **Relaying information** - Passing valid transactions and blocks to other nodes  
- **Maintaining consensus** - Ensuring all nodes agree on the blockchain state
- **Providing redundancy** - Multiple copies prevent single points of failure

Running a Bitcoin node helps decentralize the network and gives you sovereignty over your Bitcoin transactions. The more nodes that exist, the more resilient and censorship-resistant the Bitcoin network becomes.

## Why Run a Node?

When you run your own Bitcoin node, you:
- Don't have to trust third parties to validate your transactions
- Contribute to Bitcoin's decentralization and security
- Can verify the total Bitcoin supply yourself
- Support the network's resistance to censorship

The Bitcoin network's strength comes from thousands of independent nodes operated by individuals around the world, each enforcing the same consensus rules without coordination from any central authority.
