The United States' national debt has now exceeded $35 trillion, signaling the unsustainable trajectory of economies built on Keynesian principles. As inflation continues to devalue fiat currencies, the need for sound money becomes more urgent.

Bitcoin, a decentralized digital currency with a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, offers an alternative to the endless money printing that has characterized modern monetary policy. Unlike fiat currencies that can be created at will by central banks, Bitcoin's scarcity is mathematically enforced by its protocol.

## The Fiat Problem

The current monetary system allows governments to spend beyond their means by simply creating new money. This leads to:

- **Inflation** - More money chasing the same goods drives up prices
- **Wealth transfer** - From savers to debtors and asset holders  
- **Boom and bust cycles** - Artificial credit expansion creates unsustainable bubbles
- **Political incentives** - Politicians can promise benefits without immediate costs

## Bitcoin as Sound Money

This fundamental difference makes Bitcoin attractive as a store of value in an era of monetary expansion and fiscal irresponsibility. As governments continue to accumulate debt and central banks continue to expand money supplies, Bitcoin stands as a potential hedge against currency debasement.

Key properties of Bitcoin as sound money:
- **Fixed supply** - Only 21 million will ever exist
- **Decentralized** - No central authority can change the rules
- **Transparent** - All transactions are publicly verifiable
- **Borderless** - Works globally without permission

## The Inevitable Reckoning

The question isn't whether fiat currencies will eventually face a reckoning, but when - and whether individuals will be prepared with sound money alternatives.

As we watch national debts spiral out of control and central banks resort to increasingly desperate measures, Bitcoin offers a lifeline to those who understand that the current system is unsustainable.

The time to prepare is now, while Bitcoin is still in its early adoption phase and before the monetary crisis becomes undeniable to everyone.
