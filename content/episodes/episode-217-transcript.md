[00:00:00] McIntosh:

What is up, PlebNation? Today is July the 9th, and this is episode 217 of Satoshi's Plebs. In today's episode, we dive into one of the most iconic financial memes of our time. 

[00:00:13] Kenshin:

That's right. Today we will talk about Printer Go BRRR which started as Internet humor but became actually a serious economic discussion. So today we'll break down what this really means, look at current money supply data, and explore Bitcoin's role as a hedge. But before before all that, let's get our house in order. 

[00:00:36] McIntosh:

Alright. Awesome. So we've got our Zap.Stream up and running. I jumped in and, posted something real quick there. 

I would love to have you on as we are recording right now. We're at block height 904,795 as we start this recording. Kenshin, it's been a bit. What's up? Yeah. 

[00:01:03] Kenshin:

I I missed you. I missed the last recording. Sorry for that. It's been busy in the Fiat world again. Mhmm. Work, what was it? Yeah. A party, basically. An after party with my department, 

[00:01:19] McIntosh:

planes. You can't miss the parties, especially the ones that give out the free alcohol tickets. Right? 

[00:01:24] Kenshin:

Right. Yeah. I was driving home. So 

[00:01:28] McIntosh:

Oh, well Yeah. Good for you. 

[00:01:31] Kenshin:

But, no. It was fun. We we were on a colleague's house and we played Swedish summer games as they call them. 

So Okay. 

[00:01:42] McIntosh:

That sounds fun. You need to dive into that. I need to know about this. What are Swedish summer games? So you have a bucket 

[00:01:50] Kenshin:

and you have golf balls and you try to put the golf balls in the bucket. That's one game. 

[00:01:57] McIntosh:

That sounds like a drinking. Yeah. Okay. 

[00:02:02] Kenshin:

What else we had? We had like, you know, arrows on the board. We had Uh-huh. Targets with a crossbow. So we called it brought a short a small crossbow, handheld crossbow. So that was really cool. Okay. 

[00:02:24] McIntosh:

So deadly weapons, golf balls, and drinking. This is I Yeah. You guys know how to do this. We're good. Yeah. And like a lot of other other mini games like that. Alright. 

[00:02:36] Kenshin:

Yeah. It was. Sounds like a lot of stuff. It's summer, a summer day, let's say, which means it rains. 

So it also rained in the middle of the of all this, but it was fine. And then we did some barbecue with, steaks and stuff. So it was quite good. So I'm not so sorry I missed this week's episode. 

[00:03:01] McIntosh:

Well, we mid we did miss you. I am sorry, but that's okay. As I said, I think on last week's episode, I mean, this is life. We've Kenshin and I both you know, we have stuff we gotta do. I'll be off, I know, sometime in September October. Excuse me. Mid October. Kenshin's gonna be taking some time off here over the next few weeks. I'm not sure exactly how much you're gonna be around, but it may be the entire, you may be gone the entire five weeks, and that's fine. 



[00:03:30] Kenshin:

Right. I have vacations for four weeks, but I would say let's say the first two weeks just to focus on starting the business up. Yeah. 

[00:03:41] McIntosh:

And I do expect a full report when you get back on the business on the new business. Right? And you'll be able to reveal it at that point you have. Right? 

[00:03:51] Kenshin:

Maybe the concept but not name or anything because I it's my real name attached on the business there. So how about you? Any news? 

[00:04:02] McIntosh:

Well, so we record I recorded last Wednesday. So that was July the 2nd it was right before the July 4. It was the second. And so I did not actually mention anything, but on, we have our fourth of July celebration. 

It was, Thursday night, actually. So the next day, our family went to a minor league baseball game. And I can't tell you the team, but, they're a double A, minor league baseball team. If you have any interest in that, you can look it up if you don't know what that means. But it's two steps below the major leagues. So they're they're not the best, but they're some of them are pretty good. The pitching actually was quite good. Some of the fielding was there were I saw some bobbles. Some of the fielding was there were I saw some bobbles, which, I mean, major leaguers make mistakes too. But What does that mean? There was quite a few baubles. Oh. Missed like, missed catches, that kind of thing. 

But the home team won, so, you know, that was fun, and it was actually a close game. In fact, the the other team scored, I wanna say, in the second or third inning. So it was one to zero for most of the game, and then they scored it was, like, the eighth or ninth inning, a couple of runs and ended up winning the game. So it was a lot of fun. There was fireworks. There was I was actually thinking not to get off on a tangent. Surprise. I guess I am. So sorry. I don't actually I don't actually think there's anything more Americana and than minor league baseball. And what I mean by that is, like, you know, you've got people singing the national anthem. You've got fireworks around the fourth of July. You've got the local sponsors. 

Like, they had this one where whenever they hit a foul ball backwards, so, like, back over the fence and over the deck, they would play like a breaking glass sound, like, you know, and say, hey. Alright. It was an advertisement for a car, like, window fixer company. Like, you know, and they'd so it they they would insert this ad. It was actually kind of funny, and there was a number of little things. I I think it was the seventh inning. They had all the kids run across the field. Like, if you were 12 and younger, you got to run across the field if you wanted to and chase this guy dressed in a cockroach suit, which sounds stupid, but he was advertising, some pest companies, pest, you know, like a pest control company. 

Just stuff like that. And and I don't know. It was just so so American, so typical. And it's not the kind of thing I go to very often, but, frankly, we enjoyed ourself. We may go back again in the in the fall. It was cool. It no. It was not cool. It was very hot. Sorry. Which was the the it was the exact opposite of cool. It was, like, 90 degrees. And, it was very hot. And other than that, though, it was really good. The only other complaint I would have is, frankly, like, the food prices are ridiculous, but that's just that's just the way things are. That's important. 

So, you know, I don't know. We had a lot of fun, though. I just thought I'd throw that out there for really for our international listeners. I mean, I think people here in The States, most people would you guys probably went, you know, on whatever. But, yeah, it was a lot of fun. Oh, it's fascinating to hear how how you spend your fourth of July type of days around Yeah. And that was new for us. We'd never done that before. And then for the fourth itself, we went over so that was the next day. We went over to some friends, and people shot off fireworks, and we ate and, you know, had some fun. 

You know? That's that's more normal for us, frankly. Oh, cool. But, yeah, it was a great time. 

[00:08:31] Kenshin:

Nice. 

[00:08:33] McIntosh:

Awesome. Alright. Why don't you do the supporters, sir? 

[00:08:37] Kenshin:

So we had we don't have where where are they? 

[00:08:45] McIntosh:

So I they're up on the fountain app. I I've got them right here. Let me just go ahead and do it. So these were about last week's episode anyways. And I gotta be honest. Kenshin, I thought you had a really good idea. I think we need to start opening these kinda live on the air. If we can somehow figure that out, I'm not for sure that we can, but we'll see. 

We had three, I guess, actually. Yeah. Three. Our friend HBH Gardens, who, I guess, goes by Will on Fountain, so it's Will, boosted a thousand sats. And he's and they said boosting as a MOE or medium of exchange. I read that earlier just a few minutes ago. I started to laugh. That was so funny to me. I don't know. It's just it was funny because they're exactly right that we are literally using Satoshi's Bitcoin as a medium of exchange when we boost and support and and this kind of thing. Yeah. And so I appreciate that, Will. Right. 

[00:09:50] Kenshin:

And they said it's quite now. Yeah. 

Should I take him? So he says, do I yeah. You were talking about medium of exchange again. Same topic as Will. And he said, do I use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange? And he says, I just boosted you. So, yes. I'm a little frustrated, he says, with Saylor as well bragging about spending fiat on Bitcoin Pizza Day and not realizing Bitcoin will inevitably be a medium of exchange. I do, however, agree with the statement, don't sell your Bitcoin with a huge asterisk. I make a distinction between selling Bitcoin and spending Bitcoin. Sell to me is exchanging it for some other money in hopes of time in the market or taking profits, which I think no one should ever do. 

But spending one's Bitcoin is great because you, add to the Bitcoin ecosystem and circle our economy. Yeah. I agree with that. And I would also say, I agree with a distinction between selling and spending. And for me, when I also spend, I try to, exchange actually fiat back to Bitcoin. So I usually try to have neutral to positive Bitcoin stack at least. But I try to use it in that sense. Whenever I have the opportunity to buy something with Bitcoin, I do it. It feels good. 

[00:11:29] McIntosh:

Yeah. I I guess I'm a little bit more simplistic. I think about this in terms of, like, a checking account and a savings account. And I can spend out of my checking account without any problem. That's what it's there for. I have my savings account. And unless it's for a specific reason, I'm not going to be spending money out of that. And, hopefully, I'm gonna be putting money into that. And, you know, savings is my Bitcoin cold storage. Right? 

I don't spend out of that unless I have a specific reason to, or whatever. And it's certainly not like as send it Mike says, you know, I'm trying to time the market or whatever, those kind of things. That's just silly. So, yeah, send it, Mike. You did great job there summarizing this. I appreciate that. I appreciate your support. And then there was one last one. Aldum at Fountain dot FM sent us 200, and 10 SATs, said Rothbard died in '95. And, and I don't know how to say this person's name. Hope. Hope. Is that there's two p's, though. I don't know. But it's the one who is still alive. Yeah. So the Austrian economics work is still not done. 

It it will never be done, really. There's a Mises Institute, m I s e s. I think it's .org. I don't know that for sure, but there, you know, there are organizations who are doing that work and continue to do so. So I don't wanna turn this into an Austrian economics show even though that's really all we talked about last week. But, yeah, there's definitely stuff stuff out there. I did wanna mention one other thing really quickly. Somebody posted on a Noster account, and they didn't boost, which is fine. I'm just that's why I didn't see it until a day or two, a few days ago. 

But they were talking about when I was talking about my podcast that I'm working on, which I I've got sidelined with work. I haven't finished yet. Saying that, you know, the idea of using AI is for the voicing is probably not a good idea. And I get that. To be honest, I'm certainly not gonna be talking through all of this. It's a lot of a lot of text, And, it's I'm not really, like I'm trying to do a couple things. First of all, it's interesting just doing this because I'm automating the entire thing, which is, for me, a technical issue, a technical thing that I really enjoy. 

But I'm not trying to monetize this or anything like that. You know, I we'll just see how it goes, and it'll make more sense after I have it out there, and I maybe tell you a little bit more about it. But I appreciate that feedback. You know, and and you're right. It's it's not ideal, but it it's it works for this situation. Yes, Kenshin. Sorry. 

[00:14:47] Kenshin:

Yeah. I cannot do that. I I would be skeptical Mhmm. Until I listen to an AI generated podcast. 

[00:14:57] McIntosh:

 Right. 

[00:14:58] Kenshin:

And and I was shocked. I I couldn't believe that it was AI generated. Yeah. I mean, 

[00:15:05] McIntosh:

they're so good now. It has gotten a lot better, and mine is not perfect. And I'm not gonna spend the money to make it perfect unless I actually do start getting support for the podcast. And look, I think actually do start getting support for the podcast. 

And, look, I think this will make a lot more sense after I finish it. I I'm not gonna tell you about it until I finish it. As a technical exercise, if I never make anything off of this, it still will have been interesting, frankly. So 

[00:15:30] Kenshin:

Honestly, I think we had talked about it because for me also, it was useful to get the the headlines for Bitcoin news items in a quick five, ten minutes burst 

[00:15:42] McIntosh:

in a in a podcast format. Doing something like that after this if this does work and, provides a a workflow that we could work from. I could see potentially doing something for the Satoshis Plebs podcast, you know, some type of daily summary or something. 

But I'm not I'm not even thinking about that right now. 

[00:16:07] Kenshin:

I have it now another another listener feedback that you mentioned in the previous episode, and I appreciate your answer there. It was, I think, a Nostril comment, and it said something about the where we mentioned about the discrepancy between, that was a keyword discrepancy between, US dollar and Euro. Now the US dollar is so much closer to the all time high compared to the Euro. And I think, because I think I said it in a kind of, poking fun to, to you and your US dollar. Sure. And that comment correctly was saying, yes, you need to check the exchange rate between the two, the, the forex price and stuff. And and yes. I think we have talked in other episodes more in detail that, yes. They they are diverging, and the dollar is devaluing faster than the euro. Yeah. 



[00:17:12] McIntosh:

Yeah. I think it's going faster than I thought it was. I knew it was happening, but I didn't realize it was quite and I think that was Cindet Mike that actually said that. But Was it? Regardless of no. But anyway yeah. 

[00:17:26] Kenshin:

I I believe that it's just happening faster than than I Yeah. It is. The last two months is is very dramatic. I mean, it's like 10% or more something. Yeah. Is that what we're talking about today? Close. So today we're talking about Okay. Well, maybe we need to jump into that. I mean, we're talking about this meme, printer go brr, and I I assume that most of the people listening, they have heard about it one way or the other. 

So I don't think we really need to do, like, education type of things. So it's mostly about Okay. To discuss the intricacies and and why it's important. I I was just, introduced it as saying that this was mostly popularized during the COVID year as I see in the notes. So I wasn't sure myself. So it's interesting to know when was that popularized, that term. And, and, of course, in the COVID year early that year, and they essentially print a lot of money. Right? And and you can see that, especially in the m two money supply. And I like to go back and look at those charts. 

The global m two is interesting. The US m two is interesting. I I look at the Swedish one and some European countries, and they all show the same thing. They show a very constant line of, let's call it, 45 degree, line of every year and the money supply going up. And on 2020, it was a very sharp, let's say, sixty, seventy degree rise on on that supply, even more. Okay. 

[00:19:23] McIntosh:

Can you, can you explain what an m two money supply is? Right. Right. Right. 

[00:19:29] Kenshin:

Right. M two is the metric where it counts how much money is in a, let's say, society in terms of cash, deposits. What else is there? Debt, savings. Everything that you can measure as money in the in the economic system of a country is the m two supply. It's missing one or two. So there is m one, m two, m 3, but they're saying usually the m 2 is a more realistic one. 

So that's why I I mentioned the m 2, and there are also a lot of charts to compare m 2 and Bitcoin, and we'll talk about it soon. So, yes. So it's the month supply in in the society, how much money there is. And the moment a government or or the central bank, releases money into the system, and they have many ways to do that. And you see that that metric spike. And it's a constant, as I said. It is let's call it 45 degrees. I don't know exactly how much it is. Oh, no. Actually, I do know. It's, 28 or 27. I, I put a ruler, a virtual ruler up on the screen when I was doing that. 

And I saw the degrees and it was very constant for the last twenty years or something. And in 2020, it just spiked up, crazy incline. 

[00:21:02] McIntosh:

So for twenty years, we've had consistent growth Mine's a black like 20%. Yeah. Basically. That first of all, that's just crazy. Yes. I 

[00:21:13] Kenshin:

Yes. It's very disturbing. Yeah. Meaning 

[00:21:16] McIntosh:

that the amount of money in the market has grown in the total market, if we wanna call it that, is has grown by 20 zero 

[00:21:25] Kenshin:

years. No. Don't don't equate angle to increase. No. It was a 20 something degrees of angle of the slope that let's call it this, you know, a constant slope going up 20 something degrees. 

No. Degrees is not percent. So the the the percent. Yeah, the percent, the percent is actually six to 8%. That's how much it is on average annually, globally. Right. 

[00:22:02] McIntosh:

That makes a lot more sense because even though they say that inflation, you know, like, right now, I think the CPI number is, like, three and a quarter. We all know that's not true. And eventually, they will stop saying that because it's it's not true. It your number sounds a lot more like the average over the last twenty years. That's right. Six to 8% per year. Just look at stocks or assets like real estate here in The United States. That's the easiest way to almost kinda see what the interest rate not interest rate. 

Inflation rate, I for some reason, I always get that mixed up. I know what they mean, but yeah. Inflation over the last twenty years That's crazy. That that sounds about right. And, 

[00:22:49] Kenshin:

to put that in perspective, in between twenty twenty and 2021, in, eighteen months between those two years the m two in US grew 40%. Okay? 

[00:23:07] McIntosh:

It actually grew that much. Yes. Not Degrees. 

[00:23:11] Kenshin:

It it No. Yeah. It grew. And that because the number is $15,000,000,000,000 to over 21,000,000,000,000. 

[00:23:20] McIntosh:

Right. Right. 

[00:23:22] Kenshin:

So we have actual numbers there. And they cannot fake those numbers. 

[00:23:27] McIntosh:

No. No. They can. That's why ultimately this is Yeah. Never mind. I don't wanna get off of that. That sounds so conspiracy theory. Yeah. And I will tell you where this is 

[00:23:37] Kenshin:

actually true because I've been following that in my Fiat, company, as I keep saying. Right? 

Because I was always doing my own calculations to see where I'm standing with inflation and based on my salary and my the how the company I work for was performing. And I kept getting this 40% number over and over again. I saw 40% as exports increased in Sweden totally. That was the number, 40%. Then I realized that 40% were the prices my company raised on on the products they make during that period as well. And that also matches the m two at 40%. So all this matches perfectly at 40% during those years. So for me, that was more that was the actual number of the inflation during that time, unfortunately. 

And, official inflation in Sweden was around 14%. 13 what was it? 13 somewhere around there. 12 to 14 between those numbers. Two years later or one year later when it started spiking up. 

[00:24:55] McIntosh:

Right. 

[00:24:57] Kenshin:

But yeah. All this is to say that that's the result of money printing. So and money supply. So money supply, money printing, that's the result. Everything gets more expensive. Every company needs to adjust to that and increase their prices to that number. And then inflation really shows itself in one way or another, with the CPI. Of course, we know it's a bit faked, but still we see it's reacting quite heavily. And, that's why I keep also going back and reminding some family and friends also that when you see inflation and it's very easy for all of them in society here to complain about, oh, the big supermarket chain is increasing their prices and they're greedy. 

And the prices went 20% up on milk or whatever. They're very greedy and that's what make the inflation. And let's keep blaming them and politicians hang on to that too. And they say, yes, yes, yes. You see, that they So they, they do that in Sweden too. They do that a lot. It was news, touch screen. Yeah, headline news and everything. And and my my family was talking about it. I said, it that's not the that's just a quench not a result is not the 

[00:26:21] McIntosh:

It can be the case, but it's oftentimes not the case. Right? I mean, companies can take advantage of the situation and raise their prices. 

But grocery stores, for example, I promise you they're not just cranking up their price by 20% just because. It's because their inputs, the milk, is more expensive. Why is that? Well, I I don't know offhand, but, I mean, that's just the reality of their situation. We see we certainly see the same thing here. In fact, just recently, I think it was California not to pick on them, but it's easy to, so I will. They were saying, you know, something very much along those lines about the grocery store. It may have been New York. It may have been the new mayoral candidate up in New York. Like, he was talking about how they were gouging the consumer, and they were just gonna freeze prices. 

It that that's crazy. You can't that's not the way economics works. Now socialist and communist may think that that's the way it works. But let's not to pick up I'm gonna set aside the socialist so I don't offend everyone. There's no communist society where that has actually worked in the long run. Please show me one where price control, for example, of product like that works. It's that's just not it's not grounded in reality. Mhmm. Alright. Didn't mean to jump in, but but now I did it. Yeah. I find it fascinating that they do the exact same thing in Europe that they do here where they blame the grocery store. Yeah. It's easy. The grocery store CEO, I would just lay out the numbers and say, you tell me. Yeah. It's a low hanging fruit. It's easy to do. And, 

[00:28:24] Kenshin:

yeah, I I saw it from from a big corporation from within. They raised prices. No. They didn't blink. 

It's like supplies, suppliers are up, whatever iron or whatever raw materials are are are up. You need to increase prices. There's nothing to do. And then and then inflation or together with inflation or just before, because of course they react a bit faster and then the inflation catches up. But it's not because of those companies that it happens. It's because of the money supply who did it first. That that's why I go back to the printer go brew. For me, it's equal m two going up. So, yes, it's very important for us, I would say also in Bitcoin, to see how how Bitcoin reacts to that. 

And, should we get onto that? Because that's really interesting. I don't know. How does Bitcoin react to that? There is a really nice chart that overlays the m two money supply and the Bitcoin price. Okay. And that charts, they are three months apart. I don't know why three months, but it is three months. And if you It just lags. Yeah. And if you move those charts to be together instead of lagging three months, those charts are perfectly aligned. It's 

[00:29:56] McIntosh:

it's crazy. They yeah. Very much so. Do we have a copy of that we can post on the, Starshish Splebs not streaming? Do that. I can even post here on the Yeah. 

[00:30:08] Kenshin:

I can post here as a message on the Zapdot stream. 

So I will do that now. It's posted for the one viewer we have live. And we can post it on Nostril, of course, in the notes when we That is a beautiful looking chart. 

[00:30:26] McIntosh:

I'm so excited about this chart. I I'm Yeah. Why would well, why why do you think that is, Kenshin? 

[00:30:35] Kenshin:

I think because Bitcoin is hard assets, as you were talking about as well. So Bitcoin just shows the true value, of things around us and society. And, and when you compare Bitcoin to dollars, then inevitably, dollar keeps inflating and Bitcoin will show its true value compared to it. 

[00:31:04] McIntosh:

So there's no chance that the politicians are gonna stop printing money? 



[00:31:09] Kenshin:

No. If they want to be elected again. Right? 

[00:31:13] McIntosh:

I hug all my hopes on Trump, man. I I thought he was he was the golden child. Or the I guess it'd be politically incorrect to say the orange child. I don't know. Yeah. No. He, he kinda showed his hand in the last few weeks that actually What was it? Doesn't matter. We're talking last week, the big, beautiful how is it called? Bill. Bill? The big, beautiful bill. Yeah. It's signed. It's a done deal. Yeah. It's like 1,500 pages of legislation. Now do you think in that 1,500 pages of of legislation 

[00:31:50] Kenshin:

that we're gonna have less money or more money spent? Yeah. But what what wasn't that to spend even more money than ever before? What was that? 



[00:31:58] McIntosh:

It I don't know about ever before, but, yes, it's a lot of spending. Alright. And he is he he has officially just come out and said, we're going to grow our way out of this. Wow. That's literally, like, one of the lines that he's used. So in other words, it's like the Great Depression. Right? We're gonna spend a bunch of money, and then it's gonna kinda catch up with things. And there's been a lot of debate, about whether that lengthened the Great Depression or it helps. And I very much follow on the side of it, frankly, lengthened things. 

It might help in the moment, but it does not help in the long term, certainly. I think that bill just over the next couple years adds, like, $3,000,000,000,000 of debt. So just and that's well, if it were 3.6 or 3,700,000,000,000, that would be 10% of the current debt. And that's just that one bill. 

[00:33:04] Kenshin:

Right? Right. I mean, it's a big deal, certainly. 

[00:33:07] McIntosh:

But, you know, it's insane. It's just it's it's just maddening. And he comes out and says, hey. If you want to retain the majority, he's talking about the Republicans, then we have to have this bill. It's in other words, we have to spend this money so that we can stay elected 

[00:33:26] Kenshin:

so that we can spend more money. To ask you about that because you said something like that in the last episode. And I really don't like politics and I don't I don't get them. Mhmm. I don't know what is right and left, but still, I'm curious why you said they're doing this to be elected. Aren't they already elected? What do they need another election this year? Or Well, 

[00:33:48] McIntosh:

right. 

So that's just almost a technical matter. The president is elected every four years. The senators, I think, are every six years. I'm pretty sure about that. So we've got two chambers of of, of congress, senators and the house of representatives. Right? Senators are six years, but the house of representatives are every two years. So every two years, there's a set of politicians who are reelected and to retain control of congress for the Republicans who are in control right now. They have to be aware of that. It's coming up in, 2026. 

So it's next year, the middle of late next year is when the election would be. And there's, I mean, he just literally came out and said it was on Truth Social or whatever, if I'm remembering correctly. We have to spend this money so we can get reelected. And that's that's what he's supposed to do. So short term The middle term election. Election. Sacrifice 

[00:35:02] Kenshin:

sacrifice the long term for the short term. I mean, it's crazy. 

[00:35:07] McIntosh:

Exactly. Thank you. Alright. Well, at least one person in this world understands me. No. Yeah. You're exactly right, Kenshin. It is very short term thinking. 

[00:35:19] Kenshin:

I don't have an answer for it, honestly, but I said it is very short term thinking. But at least we have Bitcoin to to keep us company and warm when everything crashes and Bitcoin goes higher. 



[00:35:34] McIntosh:

My only, hope out of politics anymore and maybe it's naive. I don't know. But I hope and some of it at least we're getting some some, clarity, rules, and regulations about digital assets in general. And I would love to see Bitcoin not have capital gains tax here in The United States. Ideally, across the board, but minimally for these smaller purchases, like, they they bat around 300, 600, $800. If you spend less than that, you would not pay cap games, which means I could just set aside money to spend as Bitcoin, and no one should have any problem accepting it. Oh, I wanna buy that produce from you. Okay. Here's a 100 sats or a thousand sat well, whatever. 

Right? Mhmm. For it, they don't have it's just money. It's just a medium of exchange just like we talked about last week. Right? It's just money. And they're not getting this cap gains on it, or I'm not getting the cap gains on it for spending it. Right? I think we're still too early for that in the Bitcoin journey. 

[00:36:54] Kenshin:

They don't care. 

[00:36:57] McIntosh:

I I hope I I believe you're right, but I hope you're right. Me too. Yeah. Let me put it that way. They keep talking about it. It was supposed to be one of the things that was in this big beautiful bill, this whatever. So there and I mentioned that, but that got pulled out. So it did not happen in that case. 

Senator Loomis out of, Wyoming, if I'm remembering correctly, who is a big Bitcoin advocate, certainly is proposing a new bill. And I but, unfortunately, I think it's only $300, which is actually, in my opinion, too small. But I'll take anything at this point, because once that happens, the businesses that I frequent, I will go to them and say, look. This is Bitcoin. Oh, you've heard of Bitcoin. Okay. Let's talk about how you can accept it and increase your revenue and no fees and so on and so forth. Right? And really have a leg to stand on because they can't deal with the tax burden of dealing with Bitcoin when you have to pay a cap gains tax on it. 

It's it's just too much trouble. 

[00:38:14] Kenshin:

And Anyways. To end with some positive news, the graph we showed Yes. How it all comes together, I would say. Where are we going 

[00:38:24] McIntosh:

from here? 

[00:38:25] Kenshin:

Exactly. We see that the money printing has already started quite drastically. And that's before they do whatever they do with that. You said a big, beautiful bill. Right? Mhmm. So that money print has already started and is ongoing. And if, again, we see at this graph and we look three months ahead, if we are to believe the graph, we are minimum 50 150 from here. 



[00:38:58] McIntosh:

Yeah. It's above a 150 by decent amount. Yeah. I'm trying to find it looks like $1.70, but I don't really see all the markings. No. Okay. There's one. Doesn't go. So I guess the next mark would be 200. So it looks like it's splitting between $1.50 and Yeah. 200. Now that's not financial advice, and, you know, it may change. And who knows? But, yeah, it certainly looks promising. Now you and I have a we have some discussions about pricing. I don't wanna say bets, but I believe that and, frankly, this is the one of the one of the reasons I I've known about this chart for a while. Looking at this chart, it looks to me by by by the August, we're gonna be well up Mhmm. From where we're at. So we'll we'll see. 

I I could see before September hitting $1.50 and then going on from there. Again, not financial advice. I think I've said that enough, but, you know, as somebody who DCAs into Bitcoin on a on a weekly basis and who mines Bitcoin, almost on a daily basis, actually, on more than a daily basis. Now with Ocean, you know, these these are these are exciting. These are this is an exciting chart. Right? Yeah. But I'm not telling you to trade on this or bet on this No. Or whatever. Just this year. But you think it's gonna be September before we really get cooking? 

[00:40:38] Kenshin:

Yeah. I think it's about timing, 

[00:40:41] McIntosh:

with the summer break. We're gonna have more of the summer doldrums like normal. Right? Think so. Yeah. 

Just feels different to me, but, man, how many times have I heard that? It feels different. 

[00:40:52] Kenshin:

Yeah. I think we we will feel the Same. Slow down now in July. But, yeah, it's not financial device, DCA as usual. And it's it it 

[00:41:04] McIntosh:

We should just, like, put that in the start of the podcast. Like, record that in some nice fancy British voice. AI generated. Do not construe any of this as financial advice. Do your own research, blah blah blah blah and speed it up like two x. Oh, that's very American. 

[00:41:23] Kenshin:

I see that in American commercials. 



[00:41:26] McIntosh:

That that that's weird. We don't have that here in Europe, those type of commercials. Yeah. Because y'all are smart enough to realize that people actually know things, and they could figure things out on Zoom. Companies 

[00:41:40] Kenshin:

that like that. 

[00:41:42] McIntosh:

We we have to label our hot coffee cups, hot coffee. You might burn yourself because, you know, we're idiots. 

[00:41:50] Kenshin:

You sue each other too much. 

[00:41:53] McIntosh:

Oh, man. Don't even get me started. No. But but the kidding aside That's a that's a lovely chart. Yes. Let's let's stay here. Yeah. I would say most important for me is 

[00:42:05] Kenshin:

it's good to familiarize with with the money supply and what it means. The that's typical meme, a printer called brewer. 

And I would say it's good for people to look at the m two money supply in their country and, how it affects inflation and how it affects imports and exports in that country as well. And then you get a very good picture of of the economy. Yeah. And then again, if you overlay Bitcoin and then it's very clear what's going on. 

[00:42:38] McIntosh:

I I wanna say this. I think a lot of people think that this type discussion is boring, and I get it. It's not exciting. It's not rah rah, you know, number go up or whatever. Although that chart's pretty sweet. But, I think this type discussion or understanding, I should say, is very important. It helps you to understand and give you belief into where Bitcoin's going and why it should go that way. Right. 



[00:43:12] Kenshin:

Let's say let's ask the audience what do you think. Do you look at the m two? Do you look at correlation or, did you get something new from this discussion? 

[00:43:29] McIntosh:

Okay. That sounds great. Good. 

[00:43:33] Kenshin:

What do we have next? Do we have any news this week? 

[00:43:39] McIntosh:

There's a little bit there's a little bit. Alright. I did wanna point out not the Bitcoin, node software usage past 14%. That is pretty cool. And it's only been, what, two months? Two months ago, it was sitting at less than 5%. Just as a brief addendum onto that, the core people have continued on their merry way of not listening to anyone else. So that's all I'm gonna say about that. 

Not really a fan of what's going on there. People are very tone deaf, not not listening, not whatever. They've dismissed everyone who doesn't run core as, you know, sub ADIQ Neanderthals who can't they don't know what they're talking about. It's something I take great offense to, by the way. Just because I can't code in c plus plus or I think no. They're using c. They're actually using c, if I remember correctly. Doesn't mean I don't understand what's going on and and the implications of that. Yeah. There you go. That was literally the news. There is some software updates. Alright. Fountain. There's a few. 

I did one point out fountain excuse me. Up. Yeah. Fountain 1.2 dot eight is out on both iOS and Android. The big news sorry. I've got this cough drop in my mouth. It's not helping. The the big news there is video. They're adding video to the mix if a podcast deploys, you know, a video stream, which is, I think, awesome. I'm not a 100% on board with everything that Fountain does, but this is a discussion that's going on a lot in the podcast two point o ecosystem. I am glad that there is a player out there that is doing video. I would like to do video. I think it We would help our show, but we don't have the bandwidth. 



[00:45:51] Kenshin:

For me, it's more privacy concerns. But Yeah. Personally. 

[00:45:56] McIntosh:

Well, that can be assuaged. We don't have to show ourself, but I just think there's a lot of things that would like this chart we were just talking about, You know, to be able to look at that as you're listening to the podcast would be super helpful. And we can put it in the chapters or whatever, but still. Zeus, new beta version zero dot one one dot two. And then Robosats also came out with a new version zero dot seven dot nine. So 

[00:46:29] Kenshin:

I I must say, Zeus is really exciting. 

They they they do a lot of, good innovations in this in this field. I haven't used it recently, but every time I see, new release, I I think, yeah, I need to try them again. 

[00:46:50] McIntosh:

Yeah. Now that we've got our new nodes up and running, we probably ought to yeah. Some I think you can do some things from Zeus, actually, that lets you control your node even. Maybe worth looking into. Hey, Jake. Yeah. Some good stuff there. Our price as we record let me actually check this real quick. Woah. We're at a $111,470. We jumped $4,000. 

[00:47:24] Kenshin:

I don't see this. Well, $2,000. 



[00:47:27] McIntosh:

Oh. I had not updated this, but, yeah, quite a bit. Oh, what's this? Huge jump in the last hour. What's your euro price? Euro. 9 wow. 

[00:47:39] Kenshin:

$95,200. 95,200 

[00:47:42] McIntosh:

for euro. We're almost at an all time high. Yeah. So for the US dollars, I know that's different for y'all. Talk about it, but we are, like, a few $100 away from all time high. So that's really awesome. 

[00:47:58] Kenshin:

No. Right. No. I just want to make the same point. You're $300 away from an all time high, and euro is $10,000 away from an all time high. 

[00:48:09] McIntosh:

Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if we need to break that down for a whole episode, but that is pretty fascinating Yeah. That should that I think that's a really good indicator, actually. I think you're exactly right that the dollar is weakening. And and even though I that is what Trump wants. I mean, he said that. So maybe he's gonna get what he wants. I don't know. And then the price last July, the closing was $58,000.00 9, so $58,000, basically. 

And I had pegged that at 85.7%, but I'd had to redo my figure. Yeah. It must be higher now. It should actually be higher. So, yeah, that was a nice little boost. Yeah. That's Interesting. 90%. I wonder if some big news came out. I know what the big news was. Satoshi Platts was live on zap.stream. Where are you people at? Come on. Where are our listeners? And I would say What's that? 

[00:49:10] Kenshin:

Yeah. And I would also say it's all also inevitable, it seems. It 

[00:49:15] McIntosh:

keeps If it breaks. Just, floating there. If it breaks above this level, I will say solidly if it breaks above a 120, it is lights out, and we're heading for a 150. 

And that will happen before you blink. Not financial advice. Don't draw lines on a chart and think you know what you're doing. No. But we just we just did. But we just did. Not us, but Hey. We're just having fun here. I'm serious. We don't I don't trade on that. I don't do anything. I'm just I've already go back and listen to some old episodes if you wanna know why. I've been burned. I've lost a lot of money. I've had yeah. 

[00:50:01] Kenshin:

Don't do it. Don't do it. No. Just have fun with it. That's it. Just DCA people. It's the best thing to do. And Bitcoin market cap, it's it must be also higher, but it's at 2,200,000,000,000.0. 



[00:50:15] McIntosh:

Just go ahead and do that. Yeah. Yeah. It's 2,200,000,000,000.0 

[00:50:18] Kenshin:

and gold market cap is 23,000,000,000,000. That brings us around nine nine point four, 9.5% Bitcoin versus gold. 

[00:50:29] McIntosh:

Yeah. So we're creeping towards ten ten again. We were already at 10 at one point. Right? 10 or Close to 10. Yeah. 

[00:50:37] Kenshin:

Or oh, maybe we we went over for a second. Yeah. And our mempool, we have two sets per v bytes, and it's only 17 megabytes of unprocessed transactions and around 7,500 transactions in the queue. So, it's nice and smooth in the blockchain. So it's good time to, yeah, to do some transactions then. Very cool. 



[00:51:09] McIntosh:

Maybe we should just sit here and watch the number go up. Oh, man. You ought to see that candle. Unbelievable. Today has gone between $1.00 $8.03 $1.03 and right now at 01:11 eight seventy five roughly. Wow. Oh, wow. Is what's our all time high? According to this, May, that sounds about right. Where is that? I can't tell. Oh, it's crossing above the high today. We're already above it by a couple $100. If it breaks that all time high and comes back and test it, it's gonna go ahead and push on I see it went over 11 

[00:52:00] Kenshin:

a 112 if it went over it today. 



[00:52:04] McIntosh:

Oh, yeah. I'm seeing nine thirty on this chart, but it depends on what chart you're this is Binance. I am seeing coin Coinbase. Yeah. I could certainly see that. Well, we'll see. We could sit here live on the air and talk about Bitcoin price go up, I guess, but we shouldn't. I hope you all are enjoying this little boost. Satoshi by the way, Kenshin, before I get into this, I appreciate your research on that. That was a great summary. And, again, I just wanna highlight. I know sometimes this stuff isn't maybe the most exciting, but understanding the m two money supply and this kind of stuff, it really is important so that you're not just relying on other people. 

And and these type economic things are some of the fundamental things that provide Bitcoin value and why we're going to new all time highs. Is that fair? Maybe we should have put that up front, but there you go. Again, alright. So she's blebs is a value for value podcast supporting podcast two point o. We have no ads, sponsorships, just honest Bitcoin content. I deliberately avoid sponsors because even if I love a company, taking their money would influence my opinion. What if something goes wrong with that company? I would not I would hesitate to warn you, I should say. Instead, all we ask is are you getting value from the show? Support it through time, talent, or treasure. Help with chapters, transcripts, or future projects like our chat room, which we have. 

Or stream sats and boost boost with messages, even a 100 sats saying great show or you suck. Either way, we'll read it. Check out apps at podcastapps.com and support the independent Bitcoin media like Zeus, like Fountain. If you like not Zeus, fountain, certainly. If you like the content, I would love it if you would tell your friends about the podcast. That's the best way for us to grow. This week's music is not live for tomorrow. It is Cherry on Top by Ainsley Costello. I forgot to update that. Any booster streaming of sats during that show will go straight to the artist.
