Join McIntosh and Kenshin as they explore Bitcoin's ultimate endgame—what happens when the last Bitcoin is mined in 2140 and the network transitions to a fee-only economy. This isn't speculation; it's mathematical certainty built into Bitcoin's code.

While most people focus on short-term price action, this episode takes the ultimate long view. The hosts examine what Bitcoin looks like over a century from now when all 21 million coins have been mined and miners transition from block rewards to transaction fees alone. This represents Bitcoin reaching its final form as the hardest money ever created.

Beyond the technical mechanics, they explore what truly scarce money means for humanity—how societies function without monetary inflation and why generational thinking is peak Bitcoin mindset. Perfect for anyone curious about Bitcoin's endgame or trying to understand the long-term game theory that makes Bitcoin so powerful.
