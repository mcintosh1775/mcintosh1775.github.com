Dave Ramsey is one of the top personal financial experts in the United States. Millions of people listen to him give financial advice. I have personally benefited from implementing his advice in the past. But is he behind the times?

## Episode Transcript

Hey, Pleb Nation. Today is August 25th, and this is episode 180 of satoshis plebs. I'm your host, Macintosh, and today's episode is Dave Ramsey wrong.

We're gonna get right on into the stats of the week, and then we'll go right into our story, our discussion. This is probably the closest thing I've ever had to a clickbait title, and I don't really mean it to be. I'm being very sincere, and I will explain when we get into that section.

The weekly close just happened an hour and a half ago, August 25, 2024. We are at $64,190 to close out the week. We're at block height 858,449. We have an estimated 3.54 percent difficulty adjustment going up on August 28th, just a couple of days from now.

### Who's Dave Ramsey?

If you're outside the United States, you might not know who they are. If you are inside the United States, you probably do. Dave Ramsey has been around for a long time. He is probably, certainly in the top few, if not the number one personal finance, guru, if you wanna call it that, here in the United States.

### My Dave Ramsey Story

I have experience with Dave Ramsey from a long way back, roughly 20 more than 20 years ago. When I got out of college in the mid nineties, I ended up getting a job, a government job. Let's put it that way, a military government job.

[Long personal story about starting an ISP business, going into debt $50,000, and using Dave Ramsey's methods to pay it off over 3-4 years]

### Dave Ramsey's 7 Baby Steps

1. Save $1,000 for your starter emergency fund
2. Pay off all debt except the house using the debt snowball
3. Save 3 to 6 months of expenses in a fully funded emergency fund
4. Invest 15% of your household income in retirement
5. Save for your children's college fund
6. Pay off your home early
7. Build wealth and give

Back in the eighties, back in the nineties when Dave was getting going, even on into the 2000, easily, this was great advice. And some of it still is. You should not have debt. If you have debt, you need to take care of that.

### But Dave's Wrong About Bitcoin

Dave, historically, has said, "crypto bad, bitcoin scam" on a national radio show that reaches millions and millions of people. Obviously, I think anybody who listens to this podcast realizes that I disagree with him greatly on this point.

### Recent Comments from Dave

In April 2024, a caller asked about Bitcoin. Surprisingly, Ramsey didn't aggressively push back as he has in the past:

**"Bitcoin is a currency,"** Ramsey admitted. However, he went deeper: **"Currencies have no value except for their track record that indicates that people are willing to fight over them."**

He compared Bitcoin to other major currencies like the yuan and the Chinese yen, but pointed out that major global currencies were backed by the economic power of their issuing countries and had a much longer track record.

**"Of all the currencies, Bitcoin has the least faith... Someday it may level out and become a thing, Jason, but it's not there."**

### Why Dave's Wrong

Dave doesn't understand that, yes, it's volatile. An asset that is volatile, it is trying to establish its value. Gold on the other hand is not volatile because we've established that its value is somewhere around $2,500 per ounce.

We are still figuring out the use case, the usefulness of Bitcoin, and we are finding major new ways that it is useful as time goes on. So the volatility argument to me is a joke.

He argues that it's not an investment because it doesn't produce cash flow. Well, okay. It's a store of value, mister Ramsey. You're telling people to invest in housing as an example. The reason why houses appreciate is because of inflation of the dollar.

### The Conclusion

Yes. Yes. I ask a question at the start of this podcast. **Is Dave Ramsey wrong? Yes, he is wrong.**

He is right about many things. And I know he has helped probably hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people just like my wife and I get out of debt. But Dave is from the 1980s investment model. Put your money in an index fund. Everything's gonna be okay. Invest in real estate. Get ahead.

I think there's a point in time when that doesn't work. And I believe that Bitcoin, certainly can be part of what... if you just said Dave, 5%. You've got $50,000 in assets. Maybe you should put 5% in that Bitcoin thing. Because even though I don't clearly understand it completely, it does have a 15 year track record.

**Wake up man. Just wake up. Please.**
