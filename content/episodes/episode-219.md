In this episode, host McIntosh explores the question "Is your bitcoin safe?" through an interview with Andreas, the creator of Bitcoin Safe, an open-source desktop Bitcoin wallet focused on savings and security. Unlike mobile wallets designed for daily spending, Bitcoin Safe requires hardware signers for all mainnet transactions and specializes in multi-signature wallet setups. Andreas emphasizes that real Bitcoin savings should be slow and deliberate, with multiple verification steps, rather than fast and convenient like mobile payment apps.

So join us for this great conversation that could help you secure your future.
