## Episode Transcript

Hey, Pleb Nation. Today is January 22nd, and this is episode 154, Satoshi’s Plebs. I’m your host, McIntosh, and today’s episode is Bitcoin for the risk adverse.

We’ll get in our market update, quick market update, and we’ll jump right on into things. Right now, we had a weekly close just a few hours ago as I record this and that was $41,553, which really means we haven’t changed a whole lot.

So breaking down kind of what’s going on, we have been consolidating, or even going down a little bit at this level, although it does not so far, seem to want to fall below this $41,000 level at least on the daily chart. It has gone below it on the lower chart or for higher chart chart time frames, I should say. So a 4 hour or a 1 hour chart, it will you will see that it’s actually you know, it’s going below those. And you can see that on the daily as well, but they’re not, solid parts of the candle.

Please don’t be doing leverage trades. Please don’t be risking your precious sats. Now today is not going to be so technical as last week when we were or last episode when we were talking about the desktop tool chain that I use. Today is going to be, maybe a little more philosophical.

## The ETF Impact

What are the interesting things going on actually? And I kind of mentioned this last episode as well, But it’s becoming more obvious. People people aren’t tracking it. The grayscale ETF, whatever it is called, I don’t know offhand, but people are leaving it because they are charging higher fee rates than the other ETFs.

## Bitcoin’s “Volatility” Problem

A lot of people have a perception that Bitcoin is volatile. Now I will grant you an asset that can drop 70, 80% from its top during a bear market. Yes, I guess you could you could certainly say that’s volatile, but I would argue that you’re looking at it incorrectly. You’re looking at it through the wrong time preference.

If you say, well, if I buy at 69,000 and that was back in when was that? 2022 or 2021 or maybe both. I don’t know, offhand. Something like that. And that’s volatile because we haven’t been above that since. I would argue you’re not zooming out. You’re not looking at the long enough time frame.

Bitcoin has a history now, 15 years, of essentially moving up in value becoming a better store of value, if you wanna call it that. Certainly nothing wrong with that. And I would argue that we will continue to see that.

## Why DCA Works

Here at Satoshi’s Plebs, that’s one of the reasons why we promote DCA, dollar cost averaging. If you buy regardless of the price, then over time, it’s proven that that works out. Even though you could have started at the all time high at 69,000 and DCA’d say $5 a day or $10 or it doesn’t matter the amount. It still works out, of course, regardless. You would be positive in your allocation at this point.

## The Data on Bitcoin + S&P Allocation

Ben Van Hoool posted some interesting data. If you take a 100% S and P 500 portfolio and replace 5, 10, or 15% of that portfolio with Bitcoin and hold it over a 4 year period, then your portfolio return will increase considerably.

It does not matter from what date till what date. Since 2014, that’s 10 years ago. Any date that you pick delivers a positive result regardless of Bitcoin’s volatility.

The Numbers:

5% Bitcoin allocation: 58% median increase, 70% average increase
10% Bitcoin allocation: 117% median increase, 140% average increase
15% Bitcoin allocation: 176% median increase, 210% average increase

## BlackRock Changes Everything

When BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, goes in on a Bitcoin ETF like this. When they are doing studies that say, yes. You should have Bitcoin allocation, and it should be quite significant. When their salespeople are pitching that their clients should be investing in Bitcoin. You need to take notice.

Bitcoin doesn’t need BlackRock. Bitcoin doesn’t need ETFs. But these things will come, and they are a sign that Bitcoin is doing what Bitcoin does, and it is moving through the network, and it is taking over everything as it comes along.
